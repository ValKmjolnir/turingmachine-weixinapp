# Turing Machine Simulator

This project begins as a __Graduation Design(2022 NUAA-CCST)__. And after finishing this graduation desgin, we decide to make it public using __GPLv3__ license.

This project has made a Turing Machine Simulator in weixin mini program platform. We want to use it when teaching and learning __Formal Language and Automation__ in class. Teachers and students could easily use this software because it has a great vision-based interface.

But the shortcoming of this software is that because of this vision-based interface, we could not build a large-scale turing machine model. But it is enough for students to use it to understand the concepts of FLA by making simple automation models and testing them.
